    <li>Meanwhile, prepare sauce. Combine butter, hot sauce, brown sugar and water in a medium saucepan. Bring mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, croutons and cranberries evenly among 4 dinner plates. Toss chicken with sauce and divide chicken among the four salads. Drizzle with ranch dressing and serve immediately.</li>
